### Detailed analysis on union budget of India


Hey, friend’s union budget 2021 is out, and have received very interesting feedback from the market. Market’s roar up by 5% at 1st Feb after the budget announcement.

This year's budget has been build on six pillars that will boost our economy, the pillars are:

 1. **Health and well being**
 2. **Infrastructure**
 3. **Inclusive development**
 4. **Development of human capital** 
 5. **Research and development**
 6. **Minimum government and maximum governance**

In Covid-19 the health sector of India has faced many challenges, as a result, GOI has increased the budget for the development of the health sector and its infrastructure by 137%.

The government also has estimated India's fiscal deficit for FY21 at 9.5% and has set a target of 6.8% for FY22 
This time the major focus of the government is on infrastructure various reforms have been made for this sector to boost.

R&D was a very small part of budgets earlier but now the government has realized its potential and also due to the atamanirbhar Bharat mission government has considered it as the 5th pillar of the economy.

6th pillar of the economy is minimum government and maximum governance some people in our country do not welcome this move of government but if you look at the history of our companies and economy it is very clear that private companies have performed better than public sectors companies whether its bank, oil & petroleum, aviation sector, etc.

 This move will enable the companies to improve in their productivity and also have a broad vision to achieve, whereas government should have a stronghold on regulations and governance of the companies this could help our economy to grow and also succeed.

In this blog, we will do the sector-wise analysis of the budget 2021-22 
Starting with the announcement made before 1st Feb 2021 GOI given out 3 packages accelerated a pace of structural reforms total financial impact of all 3  atamanirbhar Bharat packages including measure taken by RBI 27 lakh cr which is almost more than 13% of GDP.
